Steps to run the backend server follow:

1. Install virtualenv module with `pip install virtualenv`
2. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Run server in development mode with `python main.py` where IP is the IPv4 (the same you put in frontend properties)
